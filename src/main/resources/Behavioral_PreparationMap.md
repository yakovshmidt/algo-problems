##STAR
* Situation. Describe a specific situation. You need to give enough information that the interviewer will be able to understand the circumstances.

* Task. What were you asked or expected to do and why? What was driving you (and/or your team) to complete this project or solve this problem? What were your responsibilities in that situation?

* Action. Describe the actions taken. You should prioritize what you did, what your contribution was, and how those things were impactful. Focus on “I," not “we”.

* Result. Describe the outcome. DO NOT undercut your role in the situation, this is not the time to be modest. When talking about the result, make sure you go over what happened, how the event ended, what was accomplished, and what you learned. Be positive. Even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, it is important that something positive came from it. Remember, even when things are negative (or not what you had hoped) good things can still come from them. Oftentimes, individuals have to be prompted in this section of their answer; stand out by including this part on your own.

Notes:
* Get topics from AlgoExpert?

Remember these specific tricks for showing rather than telling:

* Use specific, memorable details. “Social network for cats” instead of “a personal project.”
Tell a story from your life. “I was trying to solve a tricky bug…” instead of “I value open source contributions.”
Use someone else’s voice. “’You really made things feel sane‘” instead of "I work well with others."
Try these tactics out on the questions below. Keep in mind, sometimes it’s easiest to start with a “tell” response, then spruce it up to “show.”

  * Tell me your biggest weakness as an engineer.
  * Describe a tricky bug you’ve encountered.
  * What’s the biggest project you’ve shipped?
  * What’s your favorite programming language? Why?
  * How do you overcome interpersonal conflicts with coworkers?
